# React Hangman

A responsive and interactive word guessing game built with React and TypeScript. The application features smooth animations, a clean interface, and dynamic visual feedback on game outcomes.

## Project Overview

React Hangman is a browser-based implementation of the classic Hangman game. Players can guess a randomly selected word one letter at a time before the hangman figure is fully drawn. The project demonstrates component-based architecture, TypeScript type safety, and dynamic UI updates through React state management.

The game runs entirely on the frontend, no backend or external database is required.

## Features

- Responsive and mobile-friendly interface  
- Animated transitions for win and loss states  
- Real-time keyboard input and validation  
- Modular, reusable React components  
- Built with modern frontend tooling (React, TypeScript, Vite)
